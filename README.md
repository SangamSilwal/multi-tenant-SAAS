# Multi-Tenant SaaS Application

A foundational multi-tenant SaaS application designed to provide isolated environments for each tenant. This project includes both backend and frontend components, facilitating tenant registration, authentication, and data management.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
multi-tenant-SAAS/
├── Backend/
└── FrontEnd/
    └── saasfrontend/
```

- **Backend/**: Contains the server-side application logic, including API endpoints, database interactions, and tenant management.
- **FrontEnd/saasfrontend/**: Houses the client-side application, responsible for user interfaces and interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Ensures data isolation and security for each tenant.
- **Tenant Registration**: Allows new tenants to register and set up their environment.
- **Authentication**: Secure login mechanisms for tenant users.
- **Scalable Design**: Structured to accommodate growth in tenant numbers and data volume.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with considerations for per-tenant database separation)
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - TypeScript
  - CSS

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB instance running locally or remotely

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `Backend/` directory.
   - Add necessary configurations (e.g., MongoDB connection string).

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd FrontEnd/saasfrontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3001` (or the default port specified).

## 📝 Notes

- **Database Considerations**: While MongoDB is currently used, there's openness to transitioning to an embedded SQL database (e.g., SQLite, DuckDB) if it better supports per-tenant data isolation and scalability.
- **Frontend Collaboration**: As the primary focus has been on backend development, contributions and enhancements to the frontend are welcome and appreciated.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Implement per-tenant database separation for improved data isolation.
- Enhance frontend interfaces for better user experience.
- Integrate role-based access controls (RBAC) for tenant users.
- Explore transitioning to embedded SQL databases for lightweight tenant environments.
